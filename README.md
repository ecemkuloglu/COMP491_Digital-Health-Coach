The main purpose of our project is to encourage people who want to start a more active
life but cannot find motivation, who find the motivation to start but do not continue, to
encourage them to a more active and healthy life. In order to achieve these goals in our
project, we send regular motivational notifications to users, when they exercise regularly
and record them, we aim to gain more motivation from the process and the progress they
make. While doing this, we also added a chatbot that users can talk to 24/7 and get
advice, we also made exercise recommendations according to the weather by showing the
weather on the homepage. We collected all these features in an ios application, we
proceeded according to MVVM during the application development phase. In this
application, we used firebase to save and pull data. We used GPT4All and Flask Local
Server for the chatbot. With all these, we have developed Time to Move, which offers an
easy use to the user.
